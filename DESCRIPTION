Description: This package is designed to make it
  easy to generate survival analysis data sets.
  We wish to experiment with how different survival
  analysis methods work in high dimensions.  We also
  wish to experiment with how these methods deal with
  non-linear structure, interactions, and varying levels
  of censoring.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.2)
